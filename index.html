          <p>How do you connect the unconnected? Mozilla and the National Science Foundation are looking for innovative wireless technologies that connect people to the Internet and to each other. A total of $2 million in prize money is available for wireless solutions that get people online after disasters or that connect communities lacking reliable Internet access.</p><a class="btn" href="http://mzl.la/WINS_EMAIL">Sign Up for Updates</a>

            <div class="markdown"><p><strong>Imagine your life without the Internet.</strong> What connections to people would you lose? To the things you love? To vital information about your community? <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/reports/broadband-progress-reports/2016-broadband-progress-report">34 million people</a> in the U.S. — 10% of the country’s population — lack access to quality Internet connectivity, a number that jumps to 39% in rural communities and 41% on Tribal lands. When disasters strike, these staggering statistics are compounded: millions more can lose vital connectivity right when it’s needed most.</p>

<p><strong>We are seeking solutions to connect the unconnected.</strong> The Wireless Innovation for a Networked Society (WINS) Challenges, run by Mozilla and sponsored by the National Science Foundation, seek <strong>practical, new wireless solutions</strong> that will help <strong>connect people to the Internet in challenging circumstances</strong>: after a disaster or in areas without sufficient connectivity. We’re seeking wireless technology innovations that <strong>will make the Internet <a href="https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IHPbriefs_openness_March_2017.pdf">more accessible</a>, resilient, and <a href="https://internethealthreport.org/v01/">healthier</a></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>A total of $2 million in prize money</strong> is available for U.S.-based entrants to one of two separate challenges:</p>

<p><strong>Off-The-Grid Internet Challenge</strong>: Wireless solutions for communication that can be rapidly deployed in post-disaster situations where Internet access is unavailable or compromised.</p>

<p><strong>Smart-Community Networks Challenge</strong>: Wireless solutions for communication that can be built on top of existing infrastructure to enhance Internet connectivity in communities that need greater access.</p>

<p>The NSF-WINS Challenges will not only <strong>identify a broad set of wireless technology solutions</strong> to increase access to the Internet, but will also <strong>broaden the dialogue around access</strong> in the United States, <strong>grow the community</strong> of problem solvers and innovators working on these issues and <strong>strengthen the network of people working toward a healthier Internet</strong>.</p>

<p>Louisiana loses a football field of wetlands every hour. I am using virtual reality to help learners understand how this land loss looks, sounds, and feels. To save the coast, we have to know the coast—what it gives us and how its loss will change our lives. My research is designed to make these connections. When students immerse themselves in the coast’s beauty and bounty, they not only expand their view of the world, but also learn how to save the landscape in their backyard. Some kids in south Louisiana grow up exploring south Louisiana’s wetlands. I want to bring the wetlands to the classroom so that students everywhere in Louisiana and eventually beyond our state can see for themselves what the coast gives us and what we stand to lose. Virtual reality offers an immediate experience, but I also ground my lessons in a community on the front lines of land loss. That is why I am working with the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw tribe, from Isle de Jean Charles, LA.</p>

<p>Each Challenge consists of two stages: a Design Concept Stage (Stage 1) and a Working Prototype Stage (Stage 2). Entrants who successfully meet the Design Concept Stage (Stage 1) judging criteria will be invited to compete in the Working Prototype Stage (Stage 2).</p>

<p>Before submitting an application, all entrants must submit an Intent to Apply form. Intent to Apply submissions will be accepted through October, 15 2017.</p>

<p>Stage 1 Design Concept submissions will be accepted through November 15, 2017. Prizes and entrants eligible to compete in Stage 2 will be announced in January 2018.</p>

<p>Stage 2 Working Prototype submissions will be accepted through June 22, 2018. Prizes will be announced in or around August 2018. Finalists during the Working Prototype Stage may be required to provide live demos for judges and/or a public audience at a Challenges Showcase in Summer 2018.</p>

<p>The NSF WINS application cycle is now closed; please see the <a href="#Apply">Application Guide</a> for more detailed information on the application process.</p>

<p>NSF WINS Challenges entrants submitted documentation outlining their concepts, prototypes, associated designs, states of operation and technical capabilities during Stage 1 of the Challenges.</p>

<p>Mozilla will publicly post the titles, teams, and descriptions of winning submissions, and winners of the Working Prototype Stage (Stage 2) will be expected to share their submissions - including general explanations of how their submissions work and advance the field - at a closing &quot;demo day&quot; showcase on August 14th, 2018. All entrants are strongly encouraged to host their documentation <a href="/#item-8">publicly and to openly</a> license their solutions (via GitHub or equivalent) to enable others to learn and benefit from the project.</p>

<p>Please see the <a href="https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/NSF-WINS-Getting-Started">getting started guide</a> for links to resources that may be useful.</p>
