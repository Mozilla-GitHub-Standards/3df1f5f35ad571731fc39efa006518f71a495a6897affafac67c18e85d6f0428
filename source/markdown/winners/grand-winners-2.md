#### Smart Community Networks Challenge Grand Prize Winners

*Many communities across the U.S. lack reliable internet access. Sometimes commercial providers don’t supply affordable access; sometimes a particular community is too isolated; sometimes the speed and quality of access is too slow. These four winners aim to leverage existing infrastructure — physical or network — to provide high-quality wireless connectivity to communities in need.*
