#### Off-the-Grid Internet Challenge Winners

*When disasters strike, communications networks are among the first pieces of critical infrastructure to overload or fail. These 10 winners leverage both the internet’s decentralized design and current wireless technology to keep people connected to each other — and vital messaging and mapping services — in the aftermath of earthquakes, hurricanes, and other disasters.*

The following awards recognize outstanding achievement during the Design Concept Stage (Stage 1) of the Challenge:

**Project Lantern | First Place ($60,000)**

A Lantern is a keychain-sized device that hosts decentralized web apps with local maps, supply locations, and more. These apps are pushed to Lanterns via long-range radio and Wi-Fi, and then saved offline to browsers for continued use. Lanterns can be distributed by emergency responders and are accessed by citizens through a special-purpose Wi-Fi network supported by the Lanterns. Project by Paper & Equator in New York, NY in collaboration with the Shared Reality Lab at McGill University; [learn more](http://lantern.works/).

**HERMES | Second Place ($40,000)**

HERMES (High­-frequency Emergency and Rural Multimedia Exchange System) is autonomous network infrastructure. It enables local calling, SMS, and basic OTT messaging, all via equipment that can fit inside two suitcases, using GSM, Software Defined Radio and High-Frequency radio technologies. Project by Rhizomatica.

**Emergency LTE | Third Place ($30,000)**

Emergency LTE is an open-source, solar- and battery-powered cellular base station that functions like an autonomous LTE network. The under-50-pound unit features a local web server with apps that allow emergency broadcasts, maps, messaging, and more. Project lead: Dr. Spencer Sevilla in Seattle, WA. 

**The Next­-Generation, Disaster Relief Mobile Phone Mesh Network | Honorable Mention ($10,000)**

This project provides a phone­-to-­phone mesh network that’s always on, even if all other systems are offline. A goTenna Mesh device unlocks connectivity using ISM radio bands, then pairs with Android and iOS phones to provide messaging and mapping, as well as back-haul connectivity when available. Project by goTenna in Brooklyn, NY; [see the network map here](http://imeshyou.com/) & [learn more](https://gotenna.com/).

**G.W.N. | Honorable Mention ($10,000)**

G.W.N. (Gridless Wireless Network) leverages ISM radio bands, Wi-Fi modules, and antennae to provide connectivity. When users connect to these durable 10-pound nodes, they can locate nearby shelters or alert emergency responders. Project lead: Dr. Alan Mickelson in Boulder, CO; [learn more](https://github.com/jilu7883/Off_The_Grid). 

**Wind: Off­-Grid Services for Everyday People | Honorable Mention ($10,000)**

Wind uses Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct, and physical infrastructure nodes built from common routers to create a peer-to-peer network. The project also features a decentralized software and content distribution system. By Guardian Project in New York; [learn more](https://guardianproject.info/wind/). 

**Baculus | Honorable Mention ($10,000)**

Baculus features a telescoping antennae/flag, a Wi-Fi access point, small computer, GPS transceiver, software defined radio, and battery, all housed inside a rolling backpack. The project provides applications like maps and message boards over an ad-hoc, self-repairing Wi-Fi network. Project Lead: Jonathan Dahan in New York; Design Lead: Ariel Cotton; [learn more](http://jedahan.com/baculus/). 

**Portable Cell Initiative | Honorable Mention ($10,000)**

This project deploys a “microcell,” or temporary cell tower, in the aftermath of a disaster. The project uses software defined radio (SDR) and a satellite modem to enable voice calls, SMS, and data services. It also networks with nearby microcells. Project lead: Arpad Kovesdy in Los Angeles, CA; [learn more](https://github.com/Ironarcher/portable-cell-initiative). 

**Othernet Relief Ecosystem | Honorable Mention ($10,000)**

Othernet Relief Ecosystem (O.R.E.) is an extension of Dhruv’s Othernet installations in Brooklyn, NY. These installations stem from a long tradition of mesh networking wherein the OpenWRT firmware alongside the B.A.T.M.A.N. protocol run on Ubiquiti hardware to form large-­scale local area networks. Each island of connectivity can be connected to each other using point-to-point antennas. A toolset of lightweight applications can live on these networks. Project lead: Dhruv Mehrotra in New York, NY; [learn more](http://othernet.xyz/).

**RAVE | Honorable Mention ($10,000)**

RAVE (Radio­-Aware Voice Engine) a push-to-talk mobile application providing high-fidelity audio communication via a peer-to-peer Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connection. Multiple RAVE devices form a multi-hop network capable of extending communication over longer distances. RAVE’s range can be extended via a network of relay nodes. These inexpensive, battery-powered devices automatically set up a mesh network that extends real-time voice and internet access throughout a whole community, and text communication over several miles.
