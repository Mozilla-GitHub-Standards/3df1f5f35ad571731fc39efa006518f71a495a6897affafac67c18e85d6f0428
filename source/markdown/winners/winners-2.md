#### Smart Community Networks Challenge Stage 1 Winners

*The following awards recognize outstanding achievement during the Design Concept Stage (Stage 1) of the Challenge:*

**Equitable Internet Initiative (EII) | First Place ($60,000)**

EII uses a system of relays to beam wireless broadband from a local ISP to vulnerable neighborhoods. The system includes solar-powered batteries, an intranet with apps, and training so local users can build and maintain the network. By the Detroit Community Technology Project, sponsored by Allied Media Projects in Detroit, MI; [learn more](http://detroitcommunitytech.org/?q=eii).

**NoogaNet | Second Place ($40,000)**

NoogaNet provides wireless access within a defined neighborhood by leveraging utility pole-­mounted Wi-Fi nodes, point­-to-­multipoint millimeter wave, and mesh technologies. The project also includes user training for installing, utilizing, and managing a wireless mesh node. Project by the Enterprise Center in Chattanooga, TN; [learn more](https://www.theenterprisectr.org/). 

**Southern Connected Communities Network | Third Place ($30,000)**

This project entails a broadband tower—-and eventually, series of towers—-that can deliver 1-Gbps speeds wirelessly to anyone in a 25-mile radius via public spectrums. The towers will be controlled by community members in rural Appalachia and the South who are currently underserved by major ISPs. Project by the Highlander Research and Education Center in New Market, TN. 

**Solar Mesh | Honorable Mention ($10,000)**

This project integrates mesh Wi-Fi access points into solar-powered light poles in order to provide connectivity to low-income households. The bandwidth is provided by T­-Mobile. Project by the San Antonio Housing Authority in TX.

**Connect the Unconnected | Honorable Mention ($10,000)**

Using a fixed wireless backbone network, this project provides public housing and homeless shelter residents in a two-­square-mile radius with connectivity at speeds up to 35 Mb/s using point-to-point and point-to-multipoint millimeter wave technology. Residents also receive digital literacy training on refurbished devices that they are permitted to keep upon graduation. Project by DigitalC in Cleveland, OH.

**Repairable Community Cellular Networks­ | Honorable Mention ($10,000)**

This project equips residents with sensors and software to carry out basic repairs and precautionary measures on OpenCellular base stations. The goal: decrease the likelihood and duration of service interruptions. Project by University of Washington in Seattle; [learn more](https://github.com/infrared0/ccm-rural-repair). 

**People's Open Network | Honorable Mention ($10,000)**

The People's Open Network uses off-­the-­shelf multi­band Wi-Fi hardware and custom open-source software to connect and automatically route internet traffic from apartment to apartment and house to house in a decentralized manner. Project by sudomesh in Oakland, CA; [learn more](https://peoplesopen.net/). 

**BarelasGig | Honorable Mention ($10,000)**

This project uses modern millimeter wave (mmW) technology to provide wireless gigabit backhaul and last-mile connectivity at a fraction of the cost of full fiber deployment. Project lead: Michael Sanchez in Albuquerque, NM. 

**NYC Mesh Community Network | Honorable Mention ($10,000)**

This project uses high-­bandwidth sector antennas, internet exchange points, mesh protocols, and solar batteries to create a community-owned, decentralized network. Project by NYC Mesh in New York City, NY; [learn more](https://nycmesh.net/). 

**Telehub 2.0 ­- DuBois MAN | Honorable Mention ($10,000)**

This project provides wireless connectivity to underserved neighborhoods and school districts through radio infrastructure mounted on light poles. The project also features educational-technology initiatives to improve academic performance. Project by W.E.B. DuBois Learning Center in Kansas City, MO; [learn more](http://www.duboislc.org/Telehub/T2/Smart-City).
