The NSF WINS Challenges are open to all U.S.-based entrants, including non-profit and for-profit organizations and individuals aged 18 and over. Team entrants may include individuals aged 13 and above, provided that a designated team lead (who will submit the project) is 18 or over. Entrant teams may be comprised of engineers, researchers, technologists, community activists, artists, hackers, designers, high school and college students, educators or anyone else with an interest in community wireless networks. Mozilla and NSF will not assist with or offer guidance on the formation of entrants. There is no limit on entrant size: an entrant could be an individual, a small group of collaborators or an entire class of students led by an instructor.
