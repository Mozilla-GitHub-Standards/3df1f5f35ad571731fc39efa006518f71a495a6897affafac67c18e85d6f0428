Entrants are encouraged to leverage open-source hardware and software, off-the-shelf components and any other commonly available technologies in the design of their network, provided that doing so does not violate any license for those technologies. Please see the [getting started guide](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/NSF-WINS-Getting-Started) for links to resources that may be useful. While entrants are encouraged to build upon their own pre-existing work, competition entries must further develop, refine or build upon existing solutions (e.g. provide new tools or documentation, test existing solutions in new environments, etc.) in order to be eligible for prizes.
