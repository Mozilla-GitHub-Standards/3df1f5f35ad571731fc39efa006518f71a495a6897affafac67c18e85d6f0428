Entrants are encouraged to leverage open-source hardware and software, off-the-shelf components and any other commonly available technologies in the design of their network, provided that doing so does not violate any license for those technologies. Please see the [getting started guide](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/NSF-WINS-Getting-Started) for links to resources that may be useful. However, entries should not consist solely of pre-existing work; the design should somehow further develop, refine, or build upon existing solutions.
