Mozilla’s goal is to connect the unconnected to the entirety of the open Internet. Our hypothesis is that solutions successful in accomplishing this goal will be interoperable and implementable by a range of actors. At Mozilla, we support this type of radical innovation through open source licensing because we have found this enables broad scalability of product solutions, and removes the single-source choke points that often prevent true inclusiveness. We recommend — but do not require — that you open source your proposed solution. If you have an alternative path to accomplish similar goals and avoid known pitfalls, simply explain your plan on the submission form.
