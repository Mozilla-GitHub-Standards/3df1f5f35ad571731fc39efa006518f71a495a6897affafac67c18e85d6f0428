#### How to Submit

Submissions to the Design Concept Stage (Stage 1) will be accepted via this website beginning June 15, 2017.

NSF WINS Challenges entrants must submit documentation outlining their concepts, prototypes, associated designs, states of operation and technical capabilities.

Templates for submissions will be made available when the application window opens.

Mozilla will publicly post the titles, teams, and descriptions of winning submissions, and winners of the Working Prototype Stage (Stage 2) will be expected to share their submissions - including general explanations of how their submissions work and advance the field - at a closing Challenges showcase in Summer 2018.  All entrants are strongly encouraged to host their documentation [publicly and to openly](/#item-8) license their solutions (via GitHub or equivalent) to enable others to learn and benefit from the project.

Please see the [getting started guide](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/NSF-WINS-Getting-Started) for links to resources that may be useful.
