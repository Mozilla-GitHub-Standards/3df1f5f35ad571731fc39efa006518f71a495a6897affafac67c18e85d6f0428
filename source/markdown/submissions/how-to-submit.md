#### How to Submit

The NSF WINS application cycle is now open; please see the [Application Guide](#Apply) for detailed information on how to apply.

NSF WINS Challenges entrants must submit documentation outlining their concepts, prototypes, associated designs, states of operation and technical capabilities.

Mozilla will publicly post the titles, teams, and descriptions of winning submissions, and winners of the Working Prototype Stage (Stage 2) will be expected to share their submissions - including general explanations of how their submissions work and advance the field - at a closing Challenges showcase in Summer 2018.  All entrants are strongly encouraged to host their documentation [publicly and to openly](/#item-8) license their solutions (via GitHub or equivalent) to enable others to learn and benefit from the project.

Please see the [getting started guide](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/NSF-WINS-Getting-Started) for links to resources that may be useful.
