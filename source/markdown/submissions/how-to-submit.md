#### How to Submit

The NSF WINS application cycle is now closed; please see the [Application Guide](#Apply) for more detailed information on the application process.

NSF WINS Challenges entrants submitted documentation outlining their concepts, prototypes, associated designs, states of operation and technical capabilities during Stage 1 of the Challenges.

Mozilla will publicly post the titles, teams, and descriptions of winning submissions, and winners of the Working Prototype Stage (Stage 2) will be expected to share their submissions - including general explanations of how their submissions work and advance the field - at a closing "demo day" showcase on August 14th, 2018. All entrants are strongly encouraged to host their documentation [publicly and to openly](/#item-8) license their solutions (via GitHub or equivalent) to enable others to learn and benefit from the project.

Please see the [getting started guide](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/NSF-WINS-Getting-Started) for links to resources that may be useful.
