#### Challenge 1: Off-the-Grid Internet Challenge

When disasters like earthquakes, tsunamis and hurricanes strike, communications networks are often among the first pieces of critical infrastructure to become overloaded or fail. The Off-the-Grid Internet Challenge seeks projects that answer the following question: how might we provide access to critical networking and communications services in the immediate aftermath of a disaster?

Projects which address this Challenge should be portable and provide access via a wireless network to common portable devices (i.e. smartphones, tablets and laptops). In addition to network access, projects should provide access to applications that would be useful in a disaster situation (for example, social networking, messaging services, directory services, voice calling and access to knowledge databases). Projects do not necessarily need to provide access to the internet, provided that users can access information and services via the network.

In addition to the general [judging criteria], projects submitted to the Off-the-Grid Internet Challenge will be judged based on the following technical criteria:

- **Portability:** How portable is the solution? 
- **Power:** Can the solution be powered, for hours or days, off of a portable power source?
- **Access:** Can the solution provide access to at least a dozen users, within a minimum radius of 250 meters?
- **Applications:** What apps does the solution provide access to? Are these apps designed in such a way that maximizes usability for the intended users?
