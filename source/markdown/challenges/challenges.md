####What We're Looking For

Each Challenge will consist of two stages: a **Design Concept Stage** and a **Working Prototype Stage**. Submissions during the Design Concept Stage should be ideas that have been rigorously researched and designed; entrants will be selected to move on to the Working Prototype Stage based on the judging criteria below.
