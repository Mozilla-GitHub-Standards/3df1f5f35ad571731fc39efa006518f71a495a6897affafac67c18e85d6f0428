#### Challenge 2: Smart Community Networks Challenge

The Smart Community Networks Challenge seeks projects that leverage existing infrastructure to provide wireless connectivity to communities in need of greater access. How might you build a community wireless network on top of municipal infrastructure (for example, street lights, utility poles, telephone booths, etc.)? How might leveraging such infrastructure lower the cost of implementation, allow the network to scale more easily or provide access where it might otherwise be unfeasible to do so?

In addition to the general [judging criteria], projects submitted to the Smart Community Networks Challenge, will be judged based on the following technical criteria:

- **Range:** Network must be able to support dozens of simultaneous users within an area of at least one square city block.
- **Bandwidth:** Network must provide robust access (at least 10Mbps download speed) to all concurrent users.
- **Network footprint:** Network should utilize a minimal footprint and make efficient use of infrastructural resources.
- **Security and privacy:** Network should provide secure access for users and respect user privacy.
