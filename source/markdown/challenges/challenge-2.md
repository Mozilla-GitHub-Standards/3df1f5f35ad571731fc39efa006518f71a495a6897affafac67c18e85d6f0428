#### Challenge 2: Smart Community Networks Challenge

**What wireless solutions for communication can be built on top of existing infrastructure to enhance internet connectivity in communities that need greater access?**

The **Smart Community Networks Challenge** seeks projects that leverage existing physical infrastructure to provide high-quality wireless connectivity to communities in need of greater access. How might you build a community wireless network on top of municipal infrastructure (for example, street lights, utility poles, telephone booths, etc.)? How might leveraging such infrastructure lower the cost of implementation, allow the network to scale more easily or provide high-quality access where it might otherwise be unfeasible to do so?

In addition to the general judging criteria, projects submitted to the Smart Community Networks Challenge will be judged based on the following technical criteria:

- **Density:** How many simultaneous users can the solution support within one square city block?
- **Range:** Over what distance can the solution provide coverage?
- **Bandwidth:** What download and upload speeds can the solution support for all concurrent users? Are these access speeds robust enough to support two-way video conversations for users?
- **Network footprint:** The network should utilize a minimal physical footprint and make efficient use of infrastructural resources.
- **Security and privacy:** The network should provide secure access for users and respect user privacy.
