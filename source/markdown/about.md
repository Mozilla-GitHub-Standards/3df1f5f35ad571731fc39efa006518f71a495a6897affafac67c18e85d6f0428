**The NSF WINS Challenges are sponsored by [the National Science Foundation (NSF)](https://www.nsf.gov/) and powered by [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/). The Challenges solicit ideas from the public to enhance wireless connectivity in communities affected by disasters and those in need of greater access. Both Challenges will run through fall 2018, with winning entrants receiving awards of up to $400,000 each.**
