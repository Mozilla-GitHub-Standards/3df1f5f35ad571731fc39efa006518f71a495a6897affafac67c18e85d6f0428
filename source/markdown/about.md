**Imagine your life without the Internet.** What connections to people would you lose? To the things you love? To vital information about your community? [34 million people](https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/reports/broadband-progress-reports/2016-broadband-progress-report) in the U.S. — 10% of the country’s population — lack access to quality Internet connectivity, a number that jumps to 39% in rural communities and 41% on Tribal lands. When disasters strike, these staggering statistics are compounded: millions more can lose vital connectivity right when it’s needed most.

**We are seeking solutions to connect the unconnected.** The Wireless Innovation for a Networked Society (WINS) Challenges, run by Mozilla and sponsored by the National Science Foundation, seek **practical, new wireless solutions** that will help **connect people to the Internet in challenging circumstances**: after a disaster or in areas without sufficient connectivity. We’re seeking wireless technology innovations that **will make the Internet [more accessible](https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IHPbriefs_openness_March_2017.pdf), resilient, and [healthier](https://internethealthreport.org/v01/)**.

**A total of $2 million in prize money** is available for U.S.-based entrants to one of two separate challenges:

**Off-The-Grid Internet Challenge**: Wireless solutions for communication that can be rapidly deployed in post-disaster situations where Internet access is unavailable or compromised.

**Smart-Community Networks Challenge**: Wireless solutions for communication that can be built on top of existing infrastructure to enhance Internet connectivity in communities that need greater access.

The NSF-WINS Challenges will not only **identify a broad set of wireless technology solutions** to increase access to the Internet, but will also **broaden the dialogue around access** in the United States, **grow the community** of problem solvers and innovators working on these issues and **strengthen the network of people working toward a healthier Internet**.
