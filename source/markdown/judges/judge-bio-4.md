**Carlos Rey-Moreno**

Carlos Rey-Moreno, PhD, received a BSc in telecommunications engineering, UC3M, a MSc in Development and International Relations, AAU, and a MSc and PhD in Telecommunications Networks for Developing Countries, URJC, in 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2015, respectively. In 2007-2011, he worked at the EHAS Foundation on rural broadband telemedicine networks in Spain, Peru and Malawi. In 2012, he moved to UWC (South Africa) and lived in rural areas to better understand peopleâ€™s communication usage and expenditure. This led to the co-creation of Zenzeleni Networks, the first community-owned ISP in rural South Africa. In studying how to scale Zenzeleni, he has co-organised two Summits of Community Networks in Africa, authored an in-depth report on the topic and co-ordinated the African component of the LibreRouter. Currently, he is with the Association for Progressive Communications, coordinating a project aimed at creating the conditions for community networks to flourish in the global south.
