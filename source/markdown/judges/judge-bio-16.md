**Steve Song**

Steve spends his time working to make affordable access to communication a reality in regions where it currently is not. He has just taken up a half-time fellowship on Access and Digital Inclusion at the Mozilla Foundation and also works with the Network Startup Resource Center.   He writes about African telecommunications at manypossibilities.net. Since 2009, Steve has been actively maintaining public maps of undersea and now terrestrial fibre optic infrastructure in Africa. He is also the founder of Village Telco, a social enterprise that builds inexpensive WiFi mesh VoIP technologies to deliver affordable voice and Internet options in under-serviced regions.
