The NSF WINS Challenges launch events will allow you to learn more about the Challenges, meet others who are interested in applying, learn more about other wireless projects happening in your area and discuss ideas for possible solutions with potential teammates. We anticipate that the events will be attended by researchers, technologists, community leaders, artists, coders/hackers, designers, high school and college students, educators and anyone else who is interested in participating in the Challenges. The launch events will be free and open to the public but will require registration prior to the event, as a limited number of seats will be available. Note: attending a launch event is purely optional and not a requirement for submitting to either of the Challenges.
