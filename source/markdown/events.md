The NSF WINS launch events will allow you to learn more about the challenges, meet others who are interested in applying, learn more about other wireless projects happening in your area and discuss ideas for possible solutions with potential teammates. We anticipate that the events will be attended by researchers, technologists, community activists, artists, hackers, designers, high school and college students, educators and anyone else who is interested in participating in the challenges. The launch events will be free and open to the public but will require registration prior to the event, as a limited number of seats will be available. A limited number of travel stipends will also be available for those who donâ€™t live in the immediate vicinity of one of the events but wish to attend.
