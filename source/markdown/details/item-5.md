**Who CANNOT enter the Challenges?**

Entrants who are not led by a U.S.-based person who is 18 years or older, organizations and companies that are not registered in the U.S., employees of Mozilla, NSF and their immediate families and anyone who has a non-awardee financial relationship with a Mozilla or NSF employee may not enter the Challenges.

**How many people can constitute an entrant?**

There is no limit on the size of an entrant. An entrant could be as small as one person or as large as an entire high school or college class, led by an instructor.

**Can a single entrant enter more than one Challenge?**

Entrants may enter both Challenges, though an entrant in both Challenges will need to submit two sets of documentation (e.g., they will need to enter each Challenge separately).

**Are entrants expected to develop everything from scratch, or may entrants utilize existing technologies when building prototypes?**

Entrants are encouraged to leverage open-source hardware and software, off-the-shelf components and any other commonly available technologies in the design of their network, provided that doing so does not violate any license for those technologies. Please see the [getting started guide](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/NSF-WINS-Getting-Started) for links to resources that may be useful.

**Do I need to submit to the Design Concept stage of a Challenge in order to submit to the Working Prototype stage of that Challenge?**

Yes, entrants who are notified that they have passed the Design Concept Stage of a Challenge can submit to the Working Prototype Stage of that same Challenge. Late entrants at the Working Prototype Stage may be considered on a case-by-case basis, if they are able to provide satisfactory design documentation.

**Can I test my prototype using real city infrastructure?**

Entrants are **not** expected to use real city infrastructure in their prototypes. The use of municipal infrastructure is subject to federal, state and local laws, and at the discretion of individual entrants.

**Can I submit a partial solution to the challenges (e.g., an app that can be useful in a disaster situation)?**

Only complete solutions will be considered for awards. Entrants working on individual components of solutions may wish to team up with others in order to build complete solutions.

**Are the Challenges open to tools (e.g. a toolkit for building community wireless networks), applications of tools (e.g. an existing community wireless network in a real community) or both?**

Both types of projects will be considered for awards, provided that they address the challenge criteria.

**If I submit confidential or proprietary information to the Challenges, will Mozilla honor the confidentiality of that information?**

Judges for the Challenges will be required to sign confidentiality agreements, which will preclude them from disclosing any confidential information they review as part of the judging process.
