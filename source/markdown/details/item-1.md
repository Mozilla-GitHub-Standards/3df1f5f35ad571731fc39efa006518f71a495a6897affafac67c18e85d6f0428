The NSF WINS Challenges are open to all U.S.-based entrants, including organizations (non-profit and for-profit) and individuals aged 18 and over. Team entrants may include individuals between the ages of 13 and 18, provided that a designated team lead (who will submit the project) is aged 18 or over.  

Entrants may comprise engineers, researchers, technologists, community activists, artists, hackers, designers, high school and college students, educators and anyone else with an interest in community wireless networks. While Mozilla and NSF will not assist with or offer guidance on the formation of entrants, the [events] section contains information on opportunities to meet potential collaborators. There is no limit on entrant size: an entrant could be an individual, a small group of collaborators, or an entire class of students, led by an instructor.
