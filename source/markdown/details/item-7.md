**What types of people can enter the challenges?**
All project submissions must be received by a team leader who is a U.S. resident, aged 18 and older. We imagine that teams may consist of engineers, researchers, technologists, community activists, artists, hackers, designers, high school and college students, educators and anyone else with an interest in community wireless networks. 

**How big can the teams be?**
There is no limit to the size of a team. A team could be as small as 2-3 people or as large as an entire high-school or college class, led by an instructor.

**Can a single team enter more than one Challenge?**
Teams may enter both Challenges, though a team entering both Challenges will need to submit two sets of documentation (i.e. one for each project).

Are teams expected to develop everything from scratch, or may teams utilize existing technologies when building prototypes?

Teams are encouraged to leverage open-source hardware and software, off-the-shelf components and any other commonly available technologies in the design of their network, provided that doing so does not violate the terms of use for those technologies.

Do I need to submit to or win during the Design Concept stage of a challenge in order to submit to the Working Prototype stage of that challenge?

TBD
