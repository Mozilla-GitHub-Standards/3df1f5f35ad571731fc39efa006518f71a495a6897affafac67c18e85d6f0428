Entrants participating in the NSF WINS Initiative will be required to submit documentation (detailed below) outlining their concepts/prototypes, associated designs, states of operation and technical capabilities. Entrants are strongly encouraged to host their documentation publicly (via [GitHub](https://github.com) or equivalent), in such a manner that others can learn and benefit from the project.

Documentation for the **Design Concept Stage** of the Challenges should outline how the proposed solution would be constructed and might include:

- Mockups and wireframes
- Hardware and network diagrams
- Written documentation

Once an entrant is notified that they have passed the Design Concept Stage, they will be eligible to participate in the Working Prototype Stage.

Documentation for the **Working Prototype Stage** of the Challenges should provide proof of the working prototypeâ€™s capabilities and might include:

- Network test data
- Video demos
- Photographic documentation
- Software code
- Hardware schematics
- Instruction, installation or deployment guides
